# Data Science Template

Adapted from: https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/

This is my adaptation of the Cookiecutter Data Science template.  The idea
is to create this as the standard template for my data science projects in
github.  

This is customized for my linux environmwnt and I have removed all MAC OS
references.  Refer to the above site for additional details to create your own.
